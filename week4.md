# Week 4: Productionization, Guardrails, and Monitoring

## Overview
This week you will move from prototype to production-ready agentic systems. You'll add trust layers, observability (CloudWatch), retry logic, and safeguards. The final step is to prepare and submit your capstone project integrating AWS Bedrock and CrewAI in a complete workflow.

---

## Day 1: Adding Guardrails and Trust Mechanisms

### Objectives
- Harden your agents against hallucinations and unsafe behavior.
- Introduce response validation and risk scoring.

### Tasks
- 🔗 Read: [Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html)
- 🧪 Configure:
  - Profanity filters
  - Sensitive content blocks
  - Blocking unsafe tool triggers
- 🧠 Add trust mechanisms:
  - Confidence thresholds
  - Rule-based fallback (e.g., “I don’t know” → escalate)
  - Manual override paths

---

## Day 2: Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

### Objectives
- Capture logs and metrics for every agent and tool invocation.

### Tasks
- 📈 Enable CloudWatch for:
  - Bedrock agent conversations
  - Lambda tool invocations
  - S3 reads, KB hits
- 📊 Build a CloudWatch dashboard with:
  - Agent latency (p50, p95)
  - Tool failure rate
  - KB hit/miss ratio
  - Cost estimate per invocation
- 🧾 Export logs to S3 for long-term analysis

---

## Day 3: Scaling, Cost Optimization, and Fallback Logic

### Objectives
- Prepare your system for heavy usage and reduce unnecessary cost.

### Tasks
- 💸 Compare model costs:
  - Titan vs Claude
  - KB-only queries vs LLM generation
- 🛠️ Add caching or memory reuse
  - Store previous answers in DynamoDB
  - Skip generation if result is known
- 🔁 Add multi-model fallback:
  - “If Claude fails, try Titan”
  - Log fallback path taken

---

## Day 4: Final Evaluation and QA

### Objectives
- Run stress tests and QA sessions with realistic prompts.

### Tasks
- 🧪 Simulate 100 queries across different flows
- 📝 Track:
  - Success rate
  - Average latency
  - Hallucination incidents
- 💡 Do postmortem analysis on:
  - Tool chaining bugs
  - Low-confidence escapes
  - Missed KB hits
- ✅ Update prompts, chunking, and retries based on findings

---

## Day 5: Capstone Submission and Reflection

### Objectives
- Finalize and document your production-grade agentic system.

### Tasks
- 📦 Package all deliverables:
  - `agent_config.yaml`
  - `crewai_roles.py`
  - `tools.py`, `workflow.py`
  - `logs/`, `metrics/`
  - `README.md` explaining flow + architecture
- 🎥 Optional: Record a 3–5 min demo video or notebook walkthrough
- 🧠 Reflect:
  - What would you change if this system were deployed at scale?
  - How would you build agent accountability or explainability?

---

## Deliverables for Week 4

- ✅ Guardrails and trust policies integrated
- ✅ Logging dashboard and exported metrics
- ✅ Multi-agent system stress-tested and cost-profiled
- ✅ Capstone project ready for submission
```
