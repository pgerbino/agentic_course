# Week 1: Foundations of AWS Bedrock Agents

## Overview
This week introduces Bedrock Agents, focusing on core concepts, deployment, and building your first functioning agent. You’ll also complete the foundational DeepLearning.AI course to ground your hands-on practice.

---

## Day 1: Orientation and Setup

### Objectives
- Understand what Bedrock Agents are and how they differ from raw foundation models.
- Set up your AWS environment and permissions.

### Tasks
- 🔗 Read: [Bedrock Agents Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html)
- 🔐 Create IAM role with:
  - `bedrock:*`, `lambda:InvokeFunction`, `s3:GetObject`, `logs:*`
- 🌍 Enable Bedrock in your region (`us-east-1` recommended).
- ✅ Validate access:
  ```bash
  aws bedrock list-foundation-models
````

## Day 2: DeepLearning.AI Intro – Agent Lifecycle

### Objectives

* Learn the architecture and flow of a Bedrock Agent.
* Deploy your first example agent.

### Tasks

* 📺 Watch: DeepLearning.AI Module 1–2 (\~30 mins)
* 🧠 Understand:

  * Agent system prompt
  * Action group integration
  * Session context
* 🛠️ Hands-On:

  * Create an agent in the AWS Console with a simple greeting system prompt
  * Deploy and test it with a hardcoded input like:

    ```bash
    aws bedrock-agent start-agent-conversation --agent-id ...
    ```

---

## Day 3: Action Groups and Lambda Tools

### Objectives

* Build your first Lambda-backed action group.
* Understand JSON schema binding for tool calling.

### Tasks

* 📺 Watch: DeepLearning.AI Module 3–4
* 🛠️ Write a Lambda function that returns dummy product info.
* 🧾 Define an Action Schema:

  ```json
  {
    "function": "getProductInfo",
    "description": "Fetch product info from mock DB",
    "parameters": {
      "productId": "string"
    }
  }
  ```
* ✅ Register action group and link to agent
* 🔁 Test tool use via the agent

---

## Day 4: Guardrails and Agent Memory

### Objectives

* Add safeguards and test agent memory.

### Tasks

* 📺 Watch: DeepLearning.AI Module 5–6
* 🔒 Enable guardrails:

  * Block profanity, dangerous instructions, hallucinations
* 🧠 Enable session memory (Console → Agent → Session config)
* 🧪 Test with two-turn query:

  * Turn 1: “What’s in stock?”
  * Turn 2: “Can I get two of those?”

---

## Day 5: Evaluation + Reflection

### Objectives

* Measure what’s working, log issues, reflect on architecture.

### Tasks

* 🎯 Run 10 different prompt queries
* 📉 Log tool latency, failures, KB miss rate (if enabled)
* 🔎 Compare:

  * Claude vs Titan model performance
  * Direct LLM response vs Tool-invoked response
* 📝 Journal:

  * What do you understand clearly?
  * What do you not trust yet?
  * What workflows might benefit from agents?

---

## Deliverables for Week 1

* ✅ Deployed agent with at least 1 action group (Lambda)
* ✅ Guardrails + session memory enabled
* ✅ DeepLearning.AI course modules 1–6 completed
* ✅ Log/report of agent interaction session + reflection notes

```
